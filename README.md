### About the code.

Written in Prolog as specifications requested. I placed some test problems based on specifications in first part of my pl. Go past that and you will find Q1, Q2, Q3 all broken out and documented.

### Documentation

All my code is documented. I give a brief overview on what my code is doing followed by a better description for each predicate.

### Specifications

-	swipl 7.3.26
-	libraries used clpfd, clpr, apply and yall as I used lambda expressions for Q2.

### Notes:

-	No real problems due to compilation.
-	Documentation specifies the details about each question.

### How to Run.

I wrote a one line bash shell script called run.sh, it is run by travis since travis doesn't support prolog. Another hacky approach
would be :) to use make
