## COMP3109 Assignment 2

By Ian Cleasby
--------------

### About the code.

Written in Prolog as specifications requested. I placed some test problems based on specifications in first part of my pl. Go past that and you will find Q1, Q2, Q3 all broken out and documented.

### Documentation

All my code is documented. I give a brief overview on what my code is doing followed by a better description for each predicate.

### Specifications

-	swipl 7.3.26
-	libraries used clpfd, clpr, apply and yall as I used lambda expressions for Q2.

### Notes:

-	No real problems due to compilation.
-	Documentation specifies the details about each question.

### How to Run.

I wrote a one line bash shell script called run.sh to run through travis since travis doesn't support prolog.
Results can be seen by clicking the travis  build passing link that runs the test offsite.
